                    There is never a lack of intrigue or interest in London as a destination which is makes it 
                    one of the most touristic cities in the world. The Royal intrigue is one of its main draws, 
                    as thousands of tourists descend on Buckingham Palace to get a brush with the British monarchy.<br><br>

                    Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul's Cathedral. Part of what makes London such a treat to visit is 
                    its public transport system, which makes it easy to get from one place to another without a car. 
                    With so much to see, it is easy to stay mobile in London to visit poplar landmarks in a single day, 
                    like the Tower Bridge and the Skydeck at The Shard 800 feet above the city .<br><br>
                    London is also revered for its neighborhoods and famous markets, like the Borough Market, 
                    operating since the 13th century, and the Camden Market, with small vendor stalls selling food and local goods.
